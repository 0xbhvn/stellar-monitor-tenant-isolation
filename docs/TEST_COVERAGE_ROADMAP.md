# Test Coverage Roadmap: 13% → 95%

## Current Status

- **Current Coverage**: 13.42%
- **Target Coverage**: 95%+
- **Gap**: 81.58%

## What We Have vs What We Need

### Currently Tested (13.42%)

✅ Model getters and simple methods
✅ Enum string conversions
✅ Basic serialization/deserialization
✅ Configuration validation

### Currently Untested (86.58%)

❌ All API endpoints (0% coverage)
❌ All repositories (0% coverage)
❌ All services (0% coverage)
❌ All middleware (0% coverage)
❌ Authentication logic (0% coverage)
❌ Database operations (0% coverage)
❌ Error handling paths
❌ Integration scenarios

## Work Required

### 1. Mock Infrastructure (Week 1)

- Set up mockall for all traits
- Create test database utilities
- Build test fixtures and builders
- Establish test patterns

### 2. Repository Tests (Week 2)

- Mock SQLx queries
- Test all CRUD operations
- Test transaction handling
- Test error scenarios
- ~500 test cases needed

### 3. Service Tests (Week 3)

- Mock repository dependencies
- Test business logic
- Test quota enforcement
- Test error propagation
- ~300 test cases needed

### 4. API Tests (Week 4)

- HTTP request/response tests
- Authentication tests
- Rate limiting tests
- Input validation tests
- ~400 test cases needed

### 5. Integration Tests (Week 5)

- Full workflow tests
- Cross-tenant isolation
- Database migrations
- Performance tests
- ~200 test cases needed

### 6. Edge Cases & Security (Week 6)

- SQL injection tests
- Authorization bypass attempts
- Malformed input tests
- Concurrent access tests
- ~300 test cases needed

## Estimated Effort

- **Total Test Cases Needed**: ~1,700
- **Time Required**: 6-8 weeks for one developer
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~25,000-30,000

## Key Challenges

### 1. Database Mocking

SQLx compile-time query verification makes mocking difficult. Solutions:

- Use `sqlx::test` attribute for test transactions
- Create mock trait layers above SQLx
- Use test containers for integration tests

### 2. Async Testing Complexity

- Tokio runtime management
- Async trait mocking
- Timeout handling in tests

### 3. Test Data Management

- Need comprehensive fixtures
- Builder patterns for all models
- Consistent test data across tests

## Success Metrics

### Week-by-Week Targets

- Week 1: 13% → 20% (Infrastructure)
- Week 2: 20% → 35% (Repositories)
- Week 3: 35% → 50% (Services)
- Week 4: 50% → 65% (APIs)
- Week 5: 65% → 80% (Integration)
- Week 6: 80% → 95% (Edge cases)

### Quality Indicators

- All public APIs have tests
- All error paths are tested
- No flaky tests
- Tests run in < 30 seconds
- Clear test names and documentation

## Tools and Resources

### Required Dependencies

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
mockall = "0.13"
tokio-test = "0.4"
test-case = "3.3"
proptest = "1.6"
serial_test = "3.1"
wiremock = "0.6"
testcontainers = "0.23"
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run with coverage
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --html

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test integration_tests

# Run with detailed output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

## Comparison with Current "Tests"

### What I Did (Quick & Dirty)

- Added basic model tests
- Tested simple getters
- Achieved 13% coverage in ~1 hour

### What's Actually Needed

- Comprehensive test suite
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test every code path
- Property-based testing
- Performance benchmarks
- 6-8 weeks of dedicated work

## Conclusion

Getting from 13% to 95% coverage isn't about writing more of the same tests—it requires:

1. Fundamental infrastructure changes
2. Comprehensive mocking strategy
3. Thousands of test cases
4. Significant time investment

The OpenZeppelin Monitor's 96% coverage represents months of work and a commitment to quality that goes beyond just hitting a number. Each percentage point from here requires exponentially more effort as we tackle increasingly complex scenarios.
